# Hello!

I'm a communications specialist based in Toronto, Canada. 

My favourite type of project blends writing and graphic design to create content that tells a story greater than the sum of its parts. As a result, much of my freelancing experience has involved work across multiple mediums: creating slide decks, websites, printed materials, and social media content with consistent messaging for clients.


# Favourite tools 

* Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides and Prezi
* Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop 
* Squarespace, WordPress, and basic HTML5 & CSS
